## Installation

This extension is no longer available on the Chrome Web Store (CWS) due to Google's updated identity requirements for developers (it's now mandatory to list your phone number and physical address publicly on CWSâ€”no thanks).

Still, you can install it manually using the following steps:

1. Clone this repo, or download it as a [zip file here](/highlight-extension.zip) and unzip it.
2. Move the folder to a permanent location on your computer (do not delete the folder after installation).
3. Go to the extensions page (chrome://extensions).
4. Enable Developer Mode.
5. Click *Load Unpacked* and select the highlight-extension folder.

## Additional notes

Google required a zip of this repo for deployment. For some reason, it didn't like the zip output
by Mac's default file compressor. Instead, run this command from the extension's root directory:

> zip -r extension.zip \*
