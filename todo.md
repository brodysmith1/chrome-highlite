### Save url highlights in localstorage to enable page revisiting and reload

- Currently, page data is reset on a new content.js injection
- Remaining hurdle is to somehow save the Selection points to re-highlight the old collection in the
  document
- Otherwise, infrastructure is already there to save collection between sessions.
- See here for useful source code for recreating highlighted range:

- Expand Share menu to other social platforms
- Add counter badge w animations to DOM button
